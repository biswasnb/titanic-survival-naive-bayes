# Titanic Survival Prediction Using Naive Bayes

This project uses the Titanic dataset to predict whether a passenger survived or not using the Naive Bayes classifier. The analysis involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model implementation, evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning.

## Dataset
The dataset used is the Titanic dataset, which contains information about passengers such as age, sex, class, etc., along with their survival status.

## Steps Performed
1. Perform the EDA.
2. Apply Naive Bayes classifier.
3. Evaluate the performance using Precision, Recall, F1 score and accuracy.
4. Apply hyper parameter tuning to improve performance.

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
